To run PHP in an optimized way, use the following commands:

To run it directly in the command line:

```bash
php -d opcache.enable_cli=1 -d opcache.jit_buffer_size=64M -d opcache.jit=1255 -d memory_limit=-1 newdx.php
```

For example, to run it in the background, you can use:

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s cluster 'cd /root/cluster && php -d opcache.enable_cli=1 -d opcache.jit_buffer_size=64M -d opcache.jit=1255 -d memory_limit=-1 newdx.php && tmux detach-client'
```

These commands will help you run your PHP script with optimizations either in the foreground or in the background using tmux.
